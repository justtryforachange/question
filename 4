Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of fibonacci series or not. Return true if the number is member of fibonacci series else false.

Fibonacci Series is defined by the recurrence

#code

import math

def Square(x):
    s = int(math.sqrt(x))
    return s*s == x
def checkMember(n):
    return Square(5*n*n + 4) or Square(5*n*n - 4)
n=int(input())
if(checkMember(n)==True):
    print("true")
else:
    print("false")
