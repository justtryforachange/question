1-Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

2)-Given an integer N, print all the prime numbers that lie in the range 2 to N (both inclusive).

   Print the prime numbers in different lines.

3)-Provided N you have to find out the Nth Fibonacci Number.

4)-Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of fibonacci series or not.
   Return true if the number is member of fibonacci series else false.

   Fibonacci Series is defined by the recurrence
 5)-You are given S a sequence of n integers i.e. S = s1, s2, ..., sn. Compute if it is possible to split S into two parts : s1, s2, ..., si and si+1, si+2, â€¦.., sn (0 <= i <= n)     in such a way that the first part is strictly decreasing while the second is strictly increasing one.
   Note : We say that x is strictly larger than y when x > y.
   So, a strictly increasing sequence can be 1 4 8. However, 1 4 4 is NOT a strictly increasing sequence.
   That is, in the sequence if numbers are decreasing, they can start increase at one point. And once number starts increasing, they cannot decrease at any point further.
   Sequence made up of only increasing numbers or only decreasing numbers is a valid sequence. So in both the cases, print true.
   You just need to print true/false. No need to split the sequence.
   
6)-Given a string S, remove consecutive duplicates from it recursively.
