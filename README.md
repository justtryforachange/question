# question
1-Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

2)-Given an integer N, print all the prime numbers that lie in the range 2 to N (both inclusive).

   Print the prime numbers in different lines.

3)-Provided N you have to find out the Nth Fibonacci Number.

4)-Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of fibonacci series or not.
   Return true if the number is member of fibonacci series else false.

   Fibonacci Series is defined by the recurrence
5)-Given a string S, remove consecutive duplicates from it recursively.
